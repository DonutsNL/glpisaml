# glpi saml
This plugin is a rewrite of Derrick Smith's initial SAML plugin for GLPI. This plugin is redesigned and rewritten to be compatible with GLPI10+, Support multiple saml idp's, implement user right rules and more. It allows you to configure everything from the GLPI UI and dont require coding skills. It uses GLPI core components where possible for maximum compatibility and maintainability. It implements composer for quick 3rd party library updates if security issue's requires it. It follows the PSR best-practices where possible.


# Status
PRERELEASE

# Current Focus
* Multiple IDP login
* JIT user creation WITH RULES
* Hardening the plugin

# Installation using composer
This plugin is also a registered composer package. This means you are able to download and update the plugin on stand alone GLPI installations using composer. In the future you prob want to use composer archive that will create a zip with glpisaml instead of require that will perform a full deployment.
On linux: run: 
- `apt-get install composer`
- `cd ~`
- `mkdir composer | cd composer`
- `composer require donutsnl/glpisaml v0.2.1-beta`
- `mv ./vendor/donutsnl/glpisaml [path_to_glpi_marketplace]`
- `rm -rf ./vendor`
